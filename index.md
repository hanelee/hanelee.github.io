Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the [Statistics Department at Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu/), advised by [Michael Sobel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cuKCFmcAAAAJ&hl=en). My first name is pronounced [Hayn], and my pronouns are they/them.

My statistical research interests are broadly in political methodology, such as developing an index of political bipolarization using the Wasserstein distance and applying a fused ideological and social model to roll-call votes. Substantively, I focus on polarization in American politics.

Before coming to Columbia, I was at MIT Media Lab's [Opera of the Future](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/opera-of-the-future/overview/) group for an MS, where I designed interactive musical experiences and helped produce hybrid acoustic+digital musical performances. I also received a BS from MIT in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Music.

## News

[May 2024] I will be presenting my paper on the Wasserstein Bipolarization Index at PolMeth 2024.

[May 2023] I will be presenting a poster on the fused latent factor and graphical modeling of roll-call votes at PolMeth 2023.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although the topic of opinion polarization receives much attention from the media, public opinion researchers and political scientists, the phenomenon itself has not been adequately characterized in either the lay or academic literature.  To study opinion polarization among the public, researchers compare the distributions of respondents to survey questions or track the distribution of responses to a question over time using ad-hoc methods and measures such as visual comparisons, variances, and bimodality coefficients. To remedy this situation, we build on the axiomatic approach in the economics literature on income bipolarization, specifying key properties a measure of bipolarization should satisfy: in particular, it should increase as the distribution spreads away from a center toward the poles and/or as clustering below or above this center increases.  We then show that measures of bipolarization used in public opinion research fail to satisfy one or more of these axioms. Next, we propose a p-Wasserstein polarization index that satisfies the axioms we set forth. Our index measures the dissimilarity between an observed distribution and a distribution with all the mass clustered on the lower and upper endpoints of the scale. We use our index to examine bipolarization in attitudes toward governmental COVID-19 vaccine mandates across 11 countries, finding the U.S and U.K are most polarized, China, France and India the least polarized, while the others (Brazil, Australia, Columbia, Canada, Italy, Spain) occupy an intermediate position.
