Hi! I am a PhD Candidate in the Statistics Department at Columbia University, advised by [Michael Sobel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cuKCFmcAAAAJ&hl=en). My first name is pronounced [Hayn], and my pronouns are they/them.

My statistical research interests are broadly in political methodology, such as developing an index of political bipolarization using the Wasserstein distance and an application of a fused latent factor-social graph model to roll-call votes. Substantively, I focus on polarization in American politics.

Before coming to Columbia, I was at MIT Media Lab's [Opera of the Future](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/opera-of-the-future/overview/) group for an MS, where I designed interactive musical experiences and helped produce hybrid acoustic+digital musical performances. I also received a BS from MIT in Electrical Engineering and Music.
